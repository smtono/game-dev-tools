NPC
    Dialogue Tree
        Dialogue Type
        Dialogue Options
            Dialogue Outcomes

Player chooses from dialogue options which each have their own outcomes and lead to subtrees
Which are just Dialogue Trees themselves

State machine
Take an ID for a dialogue snippet, and it will lead to another ID
There are IDs for "unexpected" and "end" and "start" etc.
Otherwise, each snippet will have a logical flow
These IDs can be stored for when encountering other NPCs who may mention certain snippets as well
So they have their own state machines based on whatever the player has previously encountered

So, each NPC will have dialogue
Blocks of dialogue that pertain to one action are called "Scenes"
Scenes are made up of individual pieces called "Dialogue"

A more rigorous overview is as follows:

SCENE Objects:
    Scene ID
        - This is how we know what to show the user and decide what the starting dialogue should be
    Starting Dialogue ID
        - This will lead to the first Dialogue which then leads to a STATE MACHINE


DIALOGUE Objects:
    Dialogue ID
        - This is what corresponds with an NPC object
    Text
        - This is the actual words associated with the piece of dialogue
    Options for responses (OPTIONAL)
        - These are pieces of text that the USER chooses in response to the Dialogue
        - These are known as "REPLIES"

REPLY Objects:
    Reply ID
        - This corresponds to the specific reply in a Dialogue
    Dialogue ID
        - Leads back to the dialogue choice that came with this Reply object
    NEXT ID
        - Leads to the NEXT Dialogue object

This is the basic idea.
So there needs to be components made for these objects, and manipulating them.
Then, worry about creation and parsing when making the actual state machine.
